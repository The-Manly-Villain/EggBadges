# Update 1.8.5, The Rebrand Update
***5/26/25*** (or 26/5/25 for nonamericans)

Happy Memorial Day

## Added
+ A new icon (and thumbnail) after 2 years (long overdue)
+ The construction of the new products building has completed (which is called Phil's Products)
+ A new color palette (got bored of the old and bland (66,66,66) and (177, 177, 177) greys)
+ Most of the UI was remade from scratch because of many of the old methods I used being complete junk
+ A game menu (will be used for more stuff, but for now only shows *Holiday Countdown* and *The Rolling of The Balls* as those are the two other games I'm currently "working" on (haven't updated *Holiday Countdown* in nearly a year))
+ Datastores are finally back! (using ProfileStore this time for everything)
+ EB Studios Member and Premium chat tags (forgot before or something)
+ Item purchasing thing in Phil's Products (literally gui and a script taken from an old game I made, *Buy Items*, but in this place. I plan on adding some kind of reward for buying stuff with them them, similar to how *Welcome to Bloxburg* does it, rewarding the player with 10% value of whatever they purchased)

## Removed
- Construction zone (and sounds)
- George's Gadgets (the map design is changing drastically and the building literally had no purpose in the three years that it has been there as I never figured out how to make trails or titles work)

## Changed
* All badge images ("2023 background" (made it in 2023 and used it for one whole badge) instead of the original (excluding the `placeholder` and `found badge in badge` badges) and no more text clipping (I had to painstakingly recreate them all from scratch as I lost all of the original files other than a few of the man face images))
* Walrus badge and image have been updated to a different one (I found one that was way less blurry and could actually be identifiable)
* Ringo easter egg badges are now a new character that I made for the default cards (I lost the original files, didn't want to recreate them, and was concerned about a certain music group striking down more of my items)
* Moved the obby location to a more secluded and hidden place than it was before because of how I wanted to keep it in while adding far better obbies
* Remade Four Corners (I hated the old version and decided to make it far better and more functional)
* Moved the shirt dummy to the products building


## Fixes
* Statue gamepass prompt (never worked before because I put a localscript in workspace)
* Proximity prompts not showing on the shirt dummy (it was set to custom style instead of default)
* Fixed one of the tester's usernames showing up twice on the board (thought I did this before)
* UI no longer becomes invisible on respawn (deactivated `ResetOnSpawn` on all of them, which I thought I did a while ago)
* Leaderboard doesn't reset after respawn (rooted from the same thing as the one above, fixed by deactivated `ResetOnSpawn`)
* Leaderboard button no longer changes the deactivated icon until it's actually pressed (found this myself on accident, the icon was changing before you released it. I left the PressedImage as the image on accident when I update)
* Walrus is back (I deleted the gui for some reason at some point)

## POSTPONED
== All of these were postponed due to the fact that I wanted to push this update out before 2026 ==
- More obbies and obby area
- Music volume adjustments (programmed it with UIDragDetectors, but they **still** haven't been released to games **yet**)
- All badge images being shown in badge menu (instead of just easter eggs)
- Resetting the death sound and time (laziness)
- Trails and titles (of course)
- Game winning currency (unpurchasable currency only obtained by completing the (future) games in EggBadges)
- New menu after clicking play button
- Lincoln's Leaderboards (things like daily and total wins for the (future) games)
- Card games (making 51 cards is draining)
- UI remake (most of the current UI use horrible methods and are 4 years old)
- Chat tag selection (for now there are only two tags and this update can hold off until I make more)
- Badge displaying (displays a selected earned badge above someone's head)
