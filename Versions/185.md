# Update 1.8.5, The Rebrand Update
<!-- __*date here*__ -->
## Added
+ A new icon (and thumbnail) after 2 years (long overdue)
+ The construction of the new products building has completed
+ A new color palette (got bored of the old and bland (66,66,66) and (177, 177, 177) greys)
+ Most of the UI was remade from scratch because of many of the old methods I used being complete junk
+ Obby area (like in *Lab Experiment* and *Make a Cake*)
+ 3 new obbies (easy, medium, hard)
+ A game menu (will be used for more stuff, but for now only shows *Holiday Countdown* and *The Rolling of The Balls* as those are the two other games I'm currently working on)
+ Datastores are back! (using ProfileStore this time for everything)
+ Daily and total four corner win boards (like daily and all time honey/cakes made in *Bee Swarm Simulator* and *Make a Cake*)
+ TRCC has already finished another building where the obby used to be for the boards
+ 

## Removed
- Most of the UI since a lot of the old methods I used were terrible
- Construction zone (and sounds)

## Changed
* Moved the obby location to a more secluded and hidden place than it was before because of how I wanted to keep it in while adding far better obbies
* Remade Four Corners (I hated the old version and decided to make it far better and more functional)
* Death sound and time is now back to being default
* There is a new menu that shows after clicking the play button
* Moved the shirt dummy to the products building
* Lighting is now Future (looks so much better than shadowmap, especially in graphics level 10)

## Fixes
* Fixed the statue gamepass prompt (never worked before because I put a localscript in workspace ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
* Fixed the proximity prompts not showing on the shirt dummy (it was set to custom style instead of default)
*
