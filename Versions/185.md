# Update 1.8.5, The Rebrand Update
<!-- __*date here*__ -->
## Added
+ A new icon (and thumbnail) after 2 years (long overdue)
+ The construction of the new products building has completed (which is called Phil's Products)
+ A new color palette (got bored of the old and bland (66,66,66) and (177, 177, 177) greys)
+ Most of the UI was remade from scratch because of many of the old methods I used being complete junk
+ Obby area (like in *Lab Experiment* and *Make a Cake*)
+ 3 new obbies (easy, medium, hard)
+ A game menu (will be used for more stuff, but for now only shows *Holiday Countdown* and *The Rolling of The Balls* as those are the two other games I'm currently "working" on (haven't updated *Holiday Countdown* in nearly a year)
+ Datastores are finally back! (using ProfileStore this time for everything)
+ Daily and total four corner win boards (like daily and all time honey/cakes made in *Bee Swarm Simulator* and *Make a Cake*)
+ TRCC has already finished another building where the obby used to be for the boards (called Lincoln's Leaderboards)
+ EB Studios Member and Premium chat tags (forgot before or something)
+ Chat tag selection to Phil's Products
+ Badges can be displayed above your character through the badges menu
+ Item purchasing thing in Phil's Products (literally gui and a script taken from an old game I made, *Buy Items*, but in this place. I plan on adding some kind of reward for buying stuff with them them, similar to how *Welcome to Bloxburg* does it, rewarding the player with 40% value of whatever they purchased)
+ 3 card games (trash, war, go fish)
+ Win currency
+ Purchasable card decks

## Removed
- Most of the UI since a lot of the old methods I used were terrible
- Construction zone (and sounds)
- George's Gadgets (the map design is changing drastically and the building literally had no purpose in the three years that it has been there as I never figured out how to make trails or titles work)

## Changed
* All badge images ("2023 background" (made it in 2023 and used it for one whole badge) instead of the original (excluding the `placeholder` and `found badge in badge` badges) and no more text clipping :D {I had to painstakingly recreate them all from scratch as I lost all of the original files other than a few of the man face images 😩})
* Walrus badge and image have been updated to a different one (I found one that was way less blurry and could actually be identifiable)
* Jeremy has been changed to 
* Ringo easter egg badges are now a new character that I made for the default cards (I lost the original files, didn't want to recreate them, and was concerned about a certain music group striking down more of my items)
* Moved the obby location to a more secluded and hidden place than it was before because of how I wanted to keep it in while adding far better obbies
* Remade Four Corners (I hated the old version and decided to make it far better and more functional)
* Death sound and time is now back to being default
* There is a new menu that shows after clicking the play button
* Moved the shirt dummy to the products building
* Lighting is now ~~Future~~ Realistic (looks so much better than ~~shadowmap~~ soft, especially in graphics level 10)
* Shirt badge is no longer awarded automatically and requires you to go to the products building and click on the claim shirt badge button (this is so it can check inventories, I don't want to prompt everyone to see their inventory when they join the game without them knowing what's happening)
* Changed the script that applies the statue code to actually wait until the description is applied before destroying itself
* Locked the feedback system to be 13+ (afaik you can't track <13 players and this is the most efficient way I can think of to enforce that)
* Self promotion easter egg is now for EB Studios
* All of the badge images are now the actual badge images since that menu isn't just for easter eggs anymore
* Sign text (changed to say server version; this update released in February 2025 and it previously said that the update should be finalized before 2025)
* Sign location (moved by the server age sign)
* Countdown board dates (Easter is the only one that needs to be changed anually for now)

## Fixes
* Statue gamepass prompt (never worked before because I put a localscript in workspace 🤦‍♂️)
* Proximity prompts not showing on the shirt dummy (it was set to custom style instead of default)
* Fixed one of the tester's usernames showing up twice on the board (thought I did this before)
* UI no longer becomes invisible on respawn (deactivated `ResetOnSpawn` on all of them, which I thought I did a while ago)
* Leaderboard doesn't reset after respawn (rooted from the same thing as the one above, fixed by deactivated `ResetOnSpawn`)
* Leaderboard button no longer changes the deactivated icon until it's actually pressed (found this myself on accident, the icon was changing before you released it. I left the PressedImage as the image on accident when I update
* Walrus is back (I deleted the gui for some reason at some point)
