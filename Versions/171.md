# 1.7.1

- Christmas map
- Old music
- Updated promocodes
- Changed the fonts to FredokaOne (luckiest guy has been extremely overused in everything ever since I changed it)
- Christmas countdown board (stole it from my other experience that I was working on)
- Forgot to save a copy of the place before I changed the colors
- Gave up on changing the UI colors as it was an absolute eyesore
- Added a new hub (Roliday 2021)
