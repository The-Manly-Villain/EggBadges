# Update 1.8.6, The Rebrand Update Part 2
***//25*** (or //25 for nonamericans)

## Added
+ A new color palette (got bored of the old and bland (66,66,66) and (177, 177, 177) greys)
+ Most of the UI was remade from scratch because of many of the old methods I used being complete junk
+ All badge images being shown in badge menu (instead of just easter eggs)
+ UI remake (most of the previous UI used horrible methods and were 4 years old)
+ Badge displaying
+ New menu shows when joining

## Removed
- 

## Changed
+ Finally reordered the badges
+ Changed feedback system to not be in Guilded (since Roblox decided to shut it down)

## Fixes
- Fixed Premium chat tag showing for nonpremium users instead of premium users (was testing it before 1.9.5 and forgot to change ~= to ==)
- Fixed "we already gave out badgeid(whatever)" output spam (never added a badge check for those ones apparently)
- Made the play button go invisible after clicking so that it can't be pressed again afterwards (easy fix)
- ***ACTUALLY*** made the life game playable
- Update log no longer has two frames (not sure if I accidentally did this in the last update or not, but I had a duplicate frame with everything in it except one button)

## POSTPONED
== All of these were postponed due to the fact that I wanted to push this update out before 2026 ==
+ Update log translations (not sure what method should be used right now as there's a deprecated one and an unreliable new one that's still being developed)
+ More obbies and obby area
+ Music volume adjustments (programmed it with UIDragDetectors, but they **still** haven't been released to games **yet**)
+ Trails and titles (of course)
+ Game winning currency (unpurchasable currency only obtained by completing the (future) games in EggBadges)
+ Lincoln's Leaderboards (things like daily and total wins for the (future) games)
+ Card games (making 51 cards is draining)
+ Chat tag selection (for now there are only two tags and this update can hold off until I make more)
+ Badge displaying (displays a selected earned badge above someone's head)
+ Removal of George's Gadgets (the map design is changing drastically and the building literally has no purpose in the three years that it has been there as I still haven't figured out how to make trails or titles work, I only saved it because of how empty the map looks without it)
