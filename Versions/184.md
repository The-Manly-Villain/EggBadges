# Update 1.8.4, The Second UI Update
<!-- __date here__ -->

**Added**
- The automatic chat messaging system (tips and stuff, disabled it when the TextChatService came out since I didn't know how to make it work with it)
- Settings menu (been in storage for two years, now with a way to disable the tip messages and change the music volume)
- Code system (used to be programmed to say doesn't exist to anything you typed)
- Two codes (1.8.4, gui overhaul update)
- AFK Tag (something in the overhead gui, been in storage for two years)
- A physical products building (donations and gamepasses were moved to a building instead of taking up space on the gui)

**Removed**
- Products menu

**Changed**
- The sign's text has been changed for the first time in three years
- The feedback system (sends directly to the Guilded server instead of using a datastore and gui)
- The overhead gui is now invisible to the player that it's parented to
- Easter egg gui (now far better and shows all badges)
- Moved the code gui section to settings (now that that menu exists and the products one was removed)
- Update log (better, more organized, and (somewhat) automatically updates (i still have to make the button, but it fetches the update information rather than making me do it)) (this took me like 3 hours to make, with 2 hours being spent trying to figure out why the link wasn't working (I tried /Versions (my versions folder) and /content seperately, but finally figured out that it had to be /content/Versions/x at the end))
