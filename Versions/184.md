# Update 1.8.4, The (second) UI Update
***12/1/24*** (or 1/12/24 for nonamericans)

## Added
- The automatic chat messaging system (tips and stuff, disabled it when the TextChatService came out since I didn't know how to make it work with it)
- Settings menu (been in storage for two years, now with a way to disable the tip messages and ~~change the music volume~~)
- AFK Tag (something in the overhead gui, been in storage for two years)
- A physical products building (donations and gamepasses will be moved to a building instead of taking up space on the gui)
- TRCC (Totally Reliable Construction Company) has set up a construction zone for the new products building (products are currently in a stand near it)
- Server age script (I deleted it unintentionally like two years ago and didn't notice ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
- A lot more text has UIStroke
- The countdown board (added in 1.7.1 for christmas and removed ever since, this one is a new one with some major American holidays)

## Removed
- Products menu
- Classic hub (had no reason to keep it as it was unoptimized and a broken disaster with nothing in it)
- The floor (I've been staring at this checkered tile floor since this games release and finally have had enough of it. This is the start of the overhaul that should hopefully be coming out in the next update)
- Four corners no longer prints the color (simply haven't bothered disabling it before)

## Changed
- The sign's text has been changed for the first time in three years
- The feedback system (sends directly to the Guilded server instead of using a datastore and gui)
- The overhead gui is now invisible to the player that it's parented to
- Easter egg gui (now far better and shows all badges)
- Moved the code gui section to settings (now that that menu exists and the products one was removed)
- Update log (better, more organized, and (somewhat) automatically updates (i still have to make the button, but it fetches the update information rather than making me do it)) (this took me like 3 hours to make, with 2 hours being spent trying to figure out why the link wasn't working (I tried /Versions (my versions folder) and /content seperately, but finally figured out that it had to be /content/Versions/x at the end))
- Grass is now grass ü§Ø (previously it was just grey on the tiled floor, this looks so much better)
- The server age sign has been changed for the third time (looked kind of out of place with the new grass, so I made it into a sinking brick wall)
- Updated the materials to the 2022 variants (didn't even know that you could do this)
- Loading screen (before it just had loading text and a circle that never loaded)
## Postponed
**Improved Datastore Update**
- Code system (currently programmed to just say the code doesn't exist)
- Saving settings (currently will reset when you rejoin the game)

**UIDragDetectors Update**
- Music volume adjustments (programmed it with UIDragDetectors, but they haven't been released to games **yet**)
