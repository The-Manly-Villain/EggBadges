# Update 1.8.5.1, The Rebrand Update Bug Fixes (part one)
***5/27/25*** (or 27/5/25 for nonamericans)

*yeah, 1.8.5 lasted for a long time*

## Added
+ Life game (I made this before pushing out 1.8.5, but didn't make a way to actually enable it; it's currently in the event hub gui)

## Removed
- The classic hub button (The area it was in got deleted as it was awful and didn't even have anything in it)

## Fixes
- Easter egg GUI shows again when the button is clicked (I was testing something a while ago and accidentally disabled the screengui instead of making the frame invisible)
- Classic hub is no longer in the active section of the event hub gui
- Easter egg GUI no longer has a bunch of blank buttons (turns out I did in fact add all of the badges to it, but never added the images (which will be added in 1.8.6))
