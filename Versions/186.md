# Update 1.8.6, The Effects Update
***0/0/25*** (or 0/0/25 for nonamericans)

## Added


## Removed
- 

## Changed
+ Finally reordered the badges
+ Changed feedback system to not be in Guilded (since Roblox decided to shut it down)
+ Matchmaking (will put users in specific servers based off of some values I set)
+ Music volume can now be changed (super buggy, will be fixed in 1.8.6.1)

## Fixes
- Fixed Premium chat tag showing for nonpremium users instead of premium users (was testing it before 1.9.5 and forgot to change ~= to ==)
- Fixed "we already gave out badgeid(whatever)" output spam (never added a badge check for those ones apparently)
- Made the play button go invisible after clicking so that it can't be pressed again afterwards (easy fix)
- ***ACTUALLY*** made the life game playable
- Update log no longer has two frames (not sure if I accidentally did this in the last update or not, but I had a duplicate frame with everything in it except one button)
- Feedback text clearing isn't layered incorrectly (I forgot to set the ZIndex to be above the other contents of the frame before)
- 1.8.5.1 is no longer titled 1.8.5 (I duplicated te 1.8.5 button and renamed it, but forgot to change the text)

## POSTPONED

+ Badge displaying (displays a selected earned badge above someone's head)
+ Removal of George's Gadgets (the map design is changing drastically and the building literally has no purpose in the three years that it has been there as I still haven't figured out how to make trails or titles work, I only saved it because of how empty the map looks without it)
