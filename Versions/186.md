# Update 1.8.6, The Effects Update
***0/0/25*** (or 0/0/25 for nonamericans)

## Added
+ Effects, more effects, some more effects, with a side of effects (added a ton of effects to enhance the game, and I love it)
+ Started making a new color palette (got bored of the old and bland (66,66,66) and (177, 177, 177) greys, and this will be finished by 1.8.7 hopefully)
+ All badge images being shown in badge menu (instead of just easter eggs)
+ Began UI remake (most of the previous UI used horrible methods and were 4 years old, all UI will be remade by 1.8.7)
+ New menu shows when joining
+ How Rude badge (neat little thing I decided to make)
+ 1 easter egg
+ Announcements (finally got around to making this, it's easy enough and super useful)
+ ***A U D I O***
+ Feedback system (now you can choose between the PlayerFeedback API and my webhook; <13 will always use the PlayerFeedback API)

## Removed
- 

## Changed
+ Finally reordered the badges
+ Changed feedback system to not be in Guilded (since Roblox decided to shut it down)
+ Matchmaking (will put users in specific servers based off of some values I set)
+ Music volume can now be changed (super buggy, will be fixed in 1.8.6.1)
