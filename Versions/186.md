# Update 1.8.6, The Effects Update
***0/0/25*** (or 0/0/25 for nonamericans)

## Added
+ Effects, more effects, some more effects, with a side of effects (added a ton of effects to enhance the game, and I love it)
+ Started making a new color palette (got bored of the old and bland (66,66,66) and (177, 177, 177) greys, and this will be finished by 1.8.7 hopefully)
+ All badge images being shown in badge menu (instead of just easter eggs)
+ New menu shows when joining
+ How Rude badge (neat little thing I decided to make)
+ 1 easter egg
+ Announcements (finally got around to making this, it's easy enough and super useful)
+ ***AUDIO***
+ Feedback system (now you can choose between the PlayerFeedback API and my webhook; <13 will always use the PlayerFeedback API)

## Removed
- 

## Changed
+ Finally reordered the badges
+ Changed feedback system to not be in Guilded (since Roblox decided to shut it down)
+ Matchmaking (will put users in specific servers based off of some values I set)
+ Music volume can now be changed (super buggy, will be fixed in 1.8.6.1)

## Fixes
- Fixed Premium chat tag showing for nonpremium users instead of premium users (was testing it before 1.9.5 and forgot to change ~= to ==)
- Fixed "we already gave out badgeid(whatever)" output spam (never added a badge check for those ones apparently)
- Made the play button go invisible after clicking so that it can't be pressed again afterwards (easy fix)
- ***ACTUALLY*** made the life game playable
- Update log no longer has two frames (not sure if I accidentally did this in the last update or not, but I had a duplicate frame with everything in it except one button)
- Feedback text clearing isn't layered incorrectly (I forgot to set the ZIndex to be above the other contents of the frame before)
- 1.8.5.1 is no longer titled 1.8.5 (I duplicated te 1.8.5 button and renamed it, but forgot to change the text)

## POSTPONED
== All of these were postponed due to the fact that I wanted to push this update out before 2026 ==
+ Wally's Word Game (had some issues with processing what was sent for some reason, should come out in one of the hotfix updates or 1.8.7)
+ Update log translations (not sure what method should be used right now as there's a deprecated one and an unreliable new one that's still being developed)
+ More obbies and obby area
+ Trails and titles (wouldn't be an EggBadges update without them being postponed)
+ Game winning currency (unpurchasable currency only obtained by completing the (future) games in EggBadges)
+ Lincoln's Leaderboards (things like daily and total wins for the (future) games)
+ Card games (making 51 cards is draining)
+ Chat tag selection (for now there are only two tags and this update can hold off until I make more)
+ Badge displaying (displays a selected earned badge above someone's head)
+ Removal of George's Gadgets (the map design is changing drastically and the building literally has no purpose in the three years that it has been there as I still haven't figured out how to make trails or titles work, I only saved it because of how empty the map looks without it)
