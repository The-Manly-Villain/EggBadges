# 1.8.3, The UI Update
**5/19/24**

- ignore the hiatus
- Updated (and fixed) all of the UI (now it looks decent and is easier to change for me)
- Added The Classic hub (will actually add stuff once it’s out in v1.8.3.1)
- Made the UI side buttons far better and more conveniently placed (moved to top and fixed clipping issues)
- Removed Promocodes tab (roblox promocodes as they seem to be deprecated)
- Added codes menu (added to products menu)
- Combined gamepass & tip menus to products
- Made the Feedback UI give the amount of seconds remaining before being able to send another report
- Fixed overhead GUI (changed the font as the other wasn’t supported with scripting for some reason)
- Fixed hub buttons clipping
